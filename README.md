# notflix
A super simple Netflix clone. No seriously.

Notflix is my take on "Just enough self-hosted Web Video." It does, in a fairly
succinct way, hosting of media that is mostly dependent on the resources of the
clients. It does no transcoding, and serves only one type of video(x.264 mp4's)
via HTML5. It relies on the user to supply data, and in a kind of wierd but easy
to understand format. Basically, you embed metadata into the filename. It's
intended to run as a standalone service for streaming or downloading media from
a very low power device, I'm personally going to attempt to use it on an Onion
Omega2+ with an SD card as a sort of personal, portable media library.
